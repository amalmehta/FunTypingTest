PROJECT NAME: FunTypingTest

META-INSTRUCTIONS:

<Read it all before acting. Ask about anything unclear, contradictory or
 underspecified — before starting and mid-build. Ask in the question widget
 (AskUserQuestion): related questions batched, concrete options, your
 recommendation first. Plain text only if the widget isn't available.>

<Make answering easy. Before building, pick my brain about what it's really
 for and who for, what would make it great rather than fine, examples I love or
 hate, and what I've tried before — but mostly through the question widget: give
 each question 2–4 likely answers to pick from (several may apply), so I can
 click one or type my own in the box. Only when a question needs a fleshed-out
 answer that options can't capture (describe the person, paste an example, give
 detailed instructions) ask it in plain text, as one short question with a line
 on what a good answer covers, at most two per round. Never a long numbered list
 of open questions. Wait for my answers and follow up where they open something
 up.>

<Don't expand scope. Anything not listed here is a proposal, including changes
 to this file — propose it, don't do it.>

<Prefer doing over describing: run the code, write the files, test it.>

<As soon as a first working version (the MVP) exists, open it for me before
 carrying on: launch the app, open the page in the browser, or run it on a real
 sample, and say in a line or two what to try. Do the same after each big change.>

<Always in scope, no proposal needed: when it goes on GitHub, a README that is
 easy to read at a glance — a line on what it is, then clear visuals
 (screenshots, a diagram or a chart), then links. Everything else goes in
 linked files: docs/INSTRUCTIONS.md (setup, run, use),
 docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md (see below) and docs/FILE-STRUCTURE.md (what's where). If what you're
 building is an application rather than a script, also a small unobtrusive feedback tab, and a settings
 button or tab (⌘, on the Mac) that gathers its preferences in one place.>

<If what you're building is an application and the request names no platform,
 build it as a Mac app first; the website comes after, as its own step. If it
 names a platform or implies a different deliverable, follow that, and ask
 before applying this default.>

<Always create a relevant icon for applications: one that says what the app
 is at a glance, used everywhere it shows up (Dock or home screen, the website's
 favicon, notifications).>

<Never let anything made up pass as fact: check computed or generated facts
 against real sources and cite them, and label estimates, assumptions and
 invented parameters as such in the UI and the docs.>

<Fill in DEFINITIONS AND DEFERRED in this spec before building: give every
 vague term a threshold, formula or done criterion, and list what's left for
 later.>

<Keep the interface clean and restrained: a warm, light palette with sparing
 accents, and dark mode checked on every component. When the visuals are open-
 ended, offer two or three mockups to pick from. Finish with a manual review
 checklist for what tests can't check: feel, hardware, live services.>

<Make it buttery smooth; this is a priority, not polish. Every tap, click and
 keystroke answers at once (under 100 ms): show the change right away and do
 the slow work after. Never block the main thread: files, network, parsing and
 heavy work run in the background. Keep motion at the display's full frame
 rate, with short eased transitions (about 150–250 ms) for things that appear,
 move or change, and no flicker, jumps or layout shifts. Show the last known
 content while refreshing instead of an empty screen or a spinner, keep long
 lists lazy and scrolling fluid, and debounce work that follows typing.
 Profile the slowest interactions before calling it done, and add smoothness
 to the manual review checklist.>

<Make equations easy to read. Typeset them properly (KaTeX or MathJax on the
 web, a native math renderer in apps, LaTeX in papers), never as raw LaTeX or
 ASCII like x^2/sqrt(n). Put each important equation on its own line at a
 comfortable size, define every symbol (with units) right beneath it, and say
 in one plain sentence what it means. Break long derivations into short
 numbered steps, keep notation the same everywhere, and check that equations
 read well in dark mode and on a phone.>

<Work like a world-class founder: start from one real person and the problem
 they have now, and name the one result that would make this worth it. Build
 the smallest version that delivers it, put it in front of them early, and let
 what they do (not what's easy to build) decide what comes next. Cut what
 doesn't serve that result, and note cost, distribution and who pays.>

<Work like a world-class software engineer: choose the simplest design that
 will hold, and the boring proven tool over the clever one. Make it correct
 first, with tests for the behavior that matters and edge cases handled; keep
 changes small and reversible; measure before optimizing; secure by default
 (no secrets in the repo, least privilege); log what will help debug it; and
 record the key decisions and trade-offs in docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md.>

<Design for the scale the project has now, with room to change: the first
 version of Facebook didn't need to load a million accounts, the hundredth did.
 Size each decision (storage, sync, caching, concurrency) to today's real load,
 and note in docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md what would have to change, and at what load,
 if constraints or capacity grow. Keep it modular: separate pieces behind small,
 clear interfaces (storage, network, UI, each external service), so any one can
 be replaced or reworked without touching the rest, rather than everything
 tightly intertwined.>

<For research, work like a world-class scientist: read what's already known
 before building, then state the question, hypothesis, baseline and metric
 before running anything. Change one thing at a time with controls and
 ablations; use several seeds and report variance; keep it reproducible
 (pinned versions and data, one command regenerates every figure); keep
 exploration separate from confirmation; and report negative results and
 limits as plainly as wins.>

<Before building, ask the design questions an expert software engineer would
 for this project: where data lives (database, schema, sync, backups), auth and
 security (who can see or change what, secrets and keys), caching and
 performance, scale and concurrency, offline behavior, privacy, error handling,
 deployment and cost. Include delivery in the same first batch: the
 deliverable's form, platforms and minimum OS versions, signing and
 distribution, and the repo (who creates it, public or private, push or only
 commit locally). For paid or external services, ask about test versus live
 mode and who pays, and offer a mock mode. Ask for real sample inputs and
 working credentials before building. Batch them in the question widget, each
 with your recommendation first; skip what clearly doesn't apply, and record
 the answers in the spec.>

<When an application takes files as input, offer a visible Upload button that
 opens the file picker, accept files dragged anywhere onto the window (not
 only onto a small drop zone), and accept pasting them with ⌘V.>

<Color-code tags, categories and types by similarity: related ones share a
 hue family, with shades far enough apart to tell them apart at a glance, in
 both light and dark mode.>

<Name things the way a person would say them — "Goal Tracker", not
 goal_tracker — for the app, its windows, titles, files people open, repo
 descriptions and README headings. When you create the GitHub repo, name it
 with no "_" or "-": one word or joined words, e.g. GoalTracker.>

<Always in scope: a system design doc in the codebase, docs/SYSTEM-DESIGN.md,
 kept current as the build changes. Cover the architecture (with a Mermaid
 diagram), each component's job, the main flows, where data lives, the key
 design decisions and their trade-offs, how it's tested, and known limits.>

<Finish by listing every deliverable: path, what it is, how to check it works.>

<Git rules (no Claude attribution, never commit .claude/) are in
 ~/.claude/CLAUDE.md and apply on their own — nothing to repeat here.>

<Keep the changelog at the bottom current.>

CONTEXT:

create a geuinely fun solo typing speed test with a clean easy to read ui. figure out wpm

DELIVERABLES:

website

DEFINITIONS AND DEFERRED:

- Word (for WPM): 5 characters including spaces. Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Words_per_minute
- WPM (the headline number): (scored characters / 5) / (seconds / 60). Scored characters = letters of each
  word typed exactly right + 1 space each, plus the word in progress if it's a correct prefix. App convention.
- Raw WPM: (all typed characters kept, incl. spaces / 5) / (seconds / 60). App convention.
- Accuracy: correct keystrokes / all keystrokes x 100; fixed mistakes still count as incorrect. App convention.
- Timer: starts on the first letter, ends at exactly 15, 30 or 60 s.
- Common words: the Oxford English Corpus top 100, per https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English
- Silly sentences: 30 original nonsense sentences written for the app (labeled as such in code).
- Personal best: highest WPM above 0 per mode (text source x duration), stored in this browser.
- Ghost pacer: dot at character floor(PB x 5 x t / 60); assumes the best run was typed at an even pace.
- Combo: consecutive correct keystrokes; shown from 10, pulses every 25; any mistake resets it.
- Calm by default: no motion while typing besides caret, text scroll and the small combo pulse; sounds and
  confetti off until turned on in Settings; confetti respects Reduce Motion.
- Clean, easy to read: 28 px monospace text (22 px on phones), three lines visible, untyped text >= 3:1 contrast.
- Smooth: keystroke handler < 16 ms (measured max 1.9 ms over 254 keys); 150-250 ms eased transitions.
- Done: npm test passes; works in light and dark, at 375 px width; the manual checklist (docs/MANUAL-REVIEW.md) is
  for the owner to run.
- Deferred: Android on-screen keyboard support (key code 229); accounts, sync and leaderboards; word-count
  sprints; punctuation/numbers mode; paste-your-own text; themed word packs; offline service worker.

OPEN QUESTIONS / ASSUMPTIONS:

Answers from the owner (2026-10-22):
- Fun: beat-your-best, combo & juice, fun content, calm & minimal. Resolved as "calm by default", juice opt-in.
- Text: common words by default, plus a "Silly sentences" mode.
- Format: timed 15/30/60 s.
- Delivery: static site, local only (localStorage). Repo: public github.com/amalmehta/FunTypingTest with GitHub Pages
  (owner asked 2026-10-23; originally local-only).
- Look: "Paper & ink" mockup (cream #FBF7F0, ink #3B342C, terracotta accent).
- Audience: the owner, for fun and practice; history chart matters.

Decided without asking:
- Website only (the deliverable names the platform, so no Mac app).
- No framework, no build step, no dependencies; native MathML for formulas instead of KaTeX.
- Feedback tab saves locally and offers Copy / an email draft with no recipient (no backend).
- Mobile typing works via keydown, which is reliable on desktop and iOS, not Android.
- Results colors: chart lines validated for contrast (#C4562F light, #D8704A dark).
